/** \defgroup flacpp FLAC C++ API
 *
 * The FLAC C++ API is the interface to libFLAC++, a set of classes
 * that encapsulate the encoders, decoders, and metadata interfaces
 * in libFLAC.
 *
 * Note that Doxygen currently has some quirks (bugs?) in the way
 * it deals with some member groups and C++ constructs.  You will find
 * some document entries in the wrong place under [NOHEADER] sections.
 * Hopefully this is not too distracting.
