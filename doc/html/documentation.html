		<span class="commandname">flac</span> has been tuned so that the default options yield a good speed vs. compression tradeoff for many kinds of input.  However, if you are looking to maximize the compression rate or speed, or want to use the full power of FLAC's metadata system, this section is for you.  If not, just skip to the <a href="#flac">next section</a>.
		<br /><br />
		The basic structure of a FLAC stream is:
		<ul>
			<li>The four byte string "<span class="code">fLaC</span>"</li>
			<li>The <a href="format.html#def_STREAMINFO"><span class="code">STREAMINFO</span></a> metadata block</li>
			<li>Zero or more other metadata blocks</li>
			<li>One or more audio frames</li>
		</ul>
		The first four bytes are to identify the FLAC stream.  The metadata that follows contains all the information about the stream except for the audio data itself.  After the metadata comes the encoded audio data.
		<br /><br />
		<b>METADATA</b>
		<br /><br />
		FLAC defines several types of metadata blocks (see the <a href="format.html">format</a> page for the complete list).  Metadata blocks can be any length and new ones can be defined.  A decoder is allowed to skip any metadata types it does not understand.  Only one is mandatory: the <span class="code">STREAMINFO</span> block.  This block has information like the sample rate, number of channels, etc., and data that can help the decoder manage its buffers, like the minimum and maximum data rate and minimum and maximum block size.  Also included in the <span class="code">STREAMINFO</span> block is the MD5 signature of the <i>unencoded</i> audio data.  This is useful for checking an entire stream for transmission errors.
		<br /><br />
		Other blocks allow for padding, seek tables, tags, cuesheets, and application-specific data.  You can see <span class="commandname">flac</span> options below for adding <span class="code">PADDING</span> blocks or specifying seek points.  FLAC does not require seek points for seeking but they can speed up seeks, or be used for cueing in editing applications.
		<br /><br />
		Also, if you have a need of a custom metadata block, you can define your own and request an ID <a href="id.html">here</a>.  Then you can reserve a <span class="code">PADDING</span> block of the correct size when encoding, and overwrite the padding block with your <span class="code">APPLICATION</span> block after encoding.  The resulting stream will be FLAC compatible; decoders that are aware of your metadata can use it and the rest will safely ignore it.
		<br /><br />
		<b>AUDIO DATA</b>
		<br /><br />
		After the metadata comes the encoded audio data.  Audio data and metadata are not interleaved.  Like most audio codecs, FLAC splits the unencoded audio data into blocks, and encodes each block separately.  The encoded block is packed into a frame and appended to the stream.  The reference encoder uses a single block size for the whole stream but the FLAC format does not require it.
		<br /><br />
		<b>BLOCKING</b>
		<br /><br />
		The block size is an important parameter to encoding.  If it is too small, the frame overhead will lower the compression.  If it is too large, the modeling stage of the compressor will not be able to generate an efficient model.  Understanding FLAC's modeling will help you to improve compression for some kinds of input by varying the block size.  In the most general case, using linear prediction on 44.1kHz audio, the optimal block size will be between 2-6 ksamples.  <span class="commandname">flac</span> defaults to a block size of 4608 in this case.  Using the fast fixed predictors, a smaller block size is usually preferable because of the smaller frame header.
		<br /><br />
		<b>INTER-CHANNEL DECORRELATION</b>
		<br /><br />
		In the case of stereo input, once the data is blocked it is optionally passed through an inter-channel decorrelation stage.  The left and right channels are converted to center and side channels through the following transformation: mid = (left + right) / 2, side = left - right.  This is a lossless process, unlike joint stereo.  For normal CD audio this can result in significant extra compression.  <span class="commandname">flac</span> has two options for this: <span class="argument">-m</span> always compresses both the left-right and mid-side versions of the block and takes the smallest frame, and <span class="argument">-M</span>, which adaptively switches between left-right and mid-side.
		<br /><br />
		<b>MODELING</b>
		<br /><br />
		In the next stage, the encoder tries to approximate the signal with a function in such a way that when the approximation is subracted, the result (called the <i>residual</i>, <i>residue</i>, or <i>error</i>) requires fewer bits-per-sample to encode.  The function's parameters also have to be transmitted so they should not be so complex as to eat up the savings.  FLAC has two methods of forming approximations: 1) fitting a simple polynomial to the signal; and 2) general linear predictive coding (LPC).  I will not go into the details here, only some generalities that involve the encoding options.
		<br /><br />
		First, fixed polynomial prediction (specified with <span class="argument">-l 0</span>) is much faster, but less accurate than LPC.  The higher the maximum LPC order, the slower, but more accurate, the model will be.  However, there are diminishing returns with increasing orders.  Also, at some point (usually around order 9) the part of the encoder that guesses what is the best order to use will start to get it wrong and the compression will actually decrease slightly; at that point you will have to you will have to use the exhaustive search option <span class="argument">-e</span> to overcome this, which is significantly slower.
		<br /><br />
		Second, the parameters for the fixed predictors can be transmitted in 3 bits whereas the parameters for the LPC model depend on the bits-per-sample and LPC order.  This means the frame header length varies depending on the method and order you choose and can affect the optimal block size.
		<br /><br />
		<b>RESIDUAL CODING</b>
		<br /><br />
		Once the model is generated, the encoder subracts the approximation from the original signal to get the residual (error) signal.  The error signal is then losslessly coded.  To do this, FLAC takes advantage of the fact that the error signal generally has a Laplacian (two-sided geometric) distribution, and that there are a set of special Huffman codes called Rice codes that can be used to efficiently encode these kind of signals quickly and without needing a dictionary.
		<br /><br />
		Rice coding involves finding a single parameter that matches a signal's distribution, then using that parameter to generate the codes.  As the distribution changes, the optimal parameter changes, so FLAC supports a method that allows the parameter to change as needed.  The residual can be broken into several <i>contexts</i> or <i>partitions</i>, each with it's own Rice parameter.  <span class="commandname">flac</span> allows you to specify how the partitioning is done with the <span class="argument">-r</span> option.  The residual can be broken into 2^<i>n</i> partitions, by using the option <span class="argument">-r n,n</span>.  The parameter <i>n</i> is called the <i>partition order</i>.  Furthermore, the encoder can be made to search through <i>m</i> to <i>n</i> partition orders, taking the best one, by specifying <span class="argument">-r m,n</span>.  Generally, the choice of n does not affect encoding speed but m,n does.  The larger the difference between m and n, the more time it will take the encoder to search for the best order.  The block size will also affect the optimal order.
		<br /><br />
		<b>FRAMING</b>
		<br /><br />
		An audio frame is preceded by a frame header and trailed by a frame footer.  The header starts with a sync code, and contains the minimum information necessary for a decoder to play the stream, like sample rate, bits per sample, etc.  It also contains the block or sample number and an 8-bit CRC of the frame header.  The sync code, frame header CRC, and block/sample number allow resynchronization and seeking even in the absence of seek points.  The frame footer contains a 16-bit CRC of the entire encoded frame for error detection.  If the reference decoder detects a CRC error it will generate a silent block.
		<br /><br />
		<b>MISCELLANEOUS</b>
		<br /><br />
		As a convenience, the reference decoder knows how to skip <a href="http://www.id3.org/">ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags</a>.  Note however that the FLAC specification does not require compliant implementations to support ID3 in any form and their use is discouraged.
		<br /><br />
		<span class="commandname">flac</span> has a verify option <span class="argument">-V</span> that verifies the output while encoding.  With this option, a decoder is run in parallel to the encoder and its output is compared against the original input.  If a difference is found <span class="commandname">flac</span> will stop with an error.

	<div class="box_header"></div>
	<div class="box_body">
		<span class="commandname">flac</span> is the command-line file encoder/decoder.  The input to the encoder and the output to the decoder must either be RIFF WAVE format, AIFF, or raw interleaved sample data.  <span class="commandname">flac</span> only supports linear PCM samples (in other words, no A-LAW, uLAW, etc.).  Another restriction (hopefully short-term) is that the input must be 8, 16, or 24 bits per sample.  This is not a limitation of the FLAC format, just the reference encoder/decoder.
		<br /><br />
		<span class="commandname">flac</span> assumes that files ending in ".wav" or that have the RIFF WAVE header present are WAVE files, and files ending in ".aif" or ".aiff" or have the AIFF header present are in AIFF files.  This may be overridden with a command-line option.  It also assumes that files ending in ".ogg" are Ogg FLAC files.  Other than this, <span class="commandname">flac</span> makes no assumptions about file extensions, though the convention is that FLAC files have the extension ".flac" (or ".fla" on ancient file systems like FAT-16).
		<br /><br />
		Before going into the full command-line description, a few other things help to sort it out: 1) <span class="commandname">flac</span> encodes by default, so you must use <b>-d</b> to decode; 2) the options <span class="argument">-0</span> .. <span class="argument">-8</span> (or <span class="argument">--fast</span> and <span class="argument">--best</span>) that control the compression level actually are just synonyms for different groups of specific encoding options (described later) and you can get the same effect by using the same options; 3) <span class="commandname">flac</span> behaves similarly to gzip in the way it handles input and output files.
		<br /><br />
		<span class="commandname">flac</span> will be invoked one of four ways, depending on whether you are encoding, decoding, testing, or analyzing:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Encoding: flac [<i><a href="#general_options">&lt;general-options&gt;</a></i>] [<i><a href="#format_options">&lt;format-options&gt;</a></i>] [<i><a href="#encoding_options">&lt;encoding options&gt;</a></i>] [inputfile [...]]
			</li>
			<li>
				Decoding: flac -d [<i><a href="#general_options">&lt;general-options&gt;</a></i>] [<i><a href="#format_options">&lt;format-options&gt;</a></i>] [<i><a href="#decoding_options">&lt;decoding options&gt;</a></i>]  [FLACfile [...]]
			</li>
			<li>
				Testing: flac -t [<i><a href="#general_options">&lt;general-options&gt;</a></i>] [FLACfile [...]]
			</li>
			<li>
				Analyzing: flac -a [<i><a href="#general_options">&lt;general-options&gt;</a></i>] [<i><a href="#analysis_options">&lt;analysis-options&gt;</a></i>] [FLACfile [...]]
			</li>
		</ul>
		In any case, if no <span class="argument">inputfile</span> is specified, stdin is assumed.  If only one inputfile is specified, it may be "-" for stdin.  When stdin is used as input, <span class="commandname">flac</span> will write to stdout.  Otherwise <span class="commandname">flac</span> will perform the desired operation on each input file to similarly named output files (meaning for encoding, the extension will be replaced with ".flac", or appended with ".flac" if the input file has no extension, and for decoding, the extension will be ".wav" for WAVE output and ".raw" for raw output).  The original file is not deleted unless --delete-input-file is specified.
		<br /><br />
		If you are encoding/decoding from stdin to a file, you should use the -o option like so:
		<ul>
			<li>
				flac [options] -o outputfile
			</li>
			<li>
				flac -d [options] -o outputfile
			</li>
			</ul>
			which are better than:
			<ul>
			<li>
				flac [options] &gt; outputfile
			</li>
			<li>
				flac -d [options] &gt; outputfile
			</li>
		</ul>
		since the former allows flac to seek backwards to write the <span class="code">STREAMINFO</span> or RIFF WAVE header contents when necessary.
		<br /><br />
		Also, you can force output data to go to stdout using <span class="argument">-c</span>.
		<br /><br />
		To encode or decode files that start with a dash, use <span class="argument">--</span> to signal the end of options, to keep the filenames themselves from being treated as options:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<span class="code">flac -V -- -01-filename.wav</span>
			</li>
		</ul>
		The encoding options affect the compression ratio and encoding speed.  The format options are used to tell <span class="commandname">flac</span> the arrangement of samples if the input file (or output file when decoding) is a raw file.  If it is a RIFF WAVE or AIFF file the format options are not needed since they are read from the AIFF/WAVE header.
		<br /><br />
		In test mode, <span class="commandname">flac</span> acts just like in decode mode, except no output file is written.  Both decode and test modes detect errors in the stream, but they also detect when the MD5 signature of the decoded audio does not match the stored MD5 signature, even when the bitstream is valid.

								&nbsp;&nbsp;Specify '<span class="argument">a</span>' to use the album gain, or '<span class="argument">t</span>' to use the track gain
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="argument">l|L</span><br />
								&nbsp;&nbsp;Specify '<span class="argument">l</span>' to peak-limit the output, so that the ReplayGain peak value is full-scale.  Specify '<span class="argument">L</span>' to use a 6dB hard limiter that kicks in when the signal approaches full-scale.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="argument">n{0|1|2|3}</span><br />
								&nbsp;&nbsp;Specify the amount of noise shaping.  ReplayGain synthesis happens in floating point; the result is dithered before converting back to integer.  This quantization adds noise.  Noise shaping tries to move the noise where you won't hear it as much.  <span class="argument">0</span> means no noise shaping, <span class="argument">1</span> means 'low', <span class="argument">2</span> means 'medium', <span class="argument">3</span> means 'high'.

					<br /><br />
					<span class="argument">-@@@-apply-replaygain-which-is-not-lossless=3</span> means 3dB preamp, use album gain, no limiting, no noise shaping.
					<br /><br />
					<span class="commandname">flac</span> uses the ReplayGain tags for the calculation.  If a stream does not have the required tags or they can't be parsed, decoding will continue with a warning, and no ReplayGain is applied to that stream.

		<span class="commandname">metaflac</span> is the command-line <span class="code">.flac</span> file metadata editor.  You can use it to list the contents of metadata blocks, edit, delete or insert blocks, and manage padding.
		<br /><br />
		<span class="commandname">metaflac</span> takes a set of "options" (though some are not optional) and a set of FLAC files to operate on.  There are three kinds of "options":
		<ul>
			<li>
				Major operations, which specify a mode of operation like listing blocks, removing blocks, etc.  These will have sub-operations describing exactly what is to be done.
			</li>
			<li>
				Shorthand operations, which are convenient synonyms for major operations.  For example, there is a shorthand operation <span class="argument">--show-sample-rate</span> that shows just the sample rate field from the <span class="code">STREAMINFO</span> metadata block.
			</li>
			<li>
				Global options, which affect all the operations.
			</li>
		</ul>
		All of these are described in the tables below.  At least one shorthand or major operation must be supplied.  You can use multiple shorthand operations to do more than one thing to a file or set of files.  Most of the common things to do to metadata have shorthand operations.  As an example, here is how to show the MD5 signatures for a set of three FLAC files:
		<br /><br />
			<span class="code">metaflac --show-md5sum file1.flac file2.flac file3.flac</span>
		<br /><br />
			Another example; this removes all DESCRIPTION and COMMENT tags in a set of FLAC files, and uses the <span class="argument">--preserve-modtime</span> global option to keep the FLAC file modification times the same (usually when files are edited the modification time is set to the current time):
		<br /><br />
			<span class="code">metaflac --preserve-modtime --remove-tag=DESCRIPTION --remove-tag=COMMENT file1.flac file2.flac file3.flac</span>

					<li>WavPack - copy <span class="commandname">flac_mac.exe</span> on top of both <span class="commandname">External/wavpack.exe</span> and <span class="commandname">External/wvunpack.exe</span></li>
					<li>RKAU - copy <span class="commandname">flac_mac.exe</span> on top of <span class="commandname">External/rkau.exe</span></li>
				</ul>
				If you choose WavPack you will also be able to use the WavPack Configuration menu to add flac options.
			</li>
			<li>Now you can encode FLAC files as if you were using the replaced encoder.  The renamed <span class="commandname">flac_mac.exe</span> utility will call <span class="commandname">flac.exe</span> and afterwards, <span class="commandname">flac_ren.exe</span> will rename the resulting file to have the .flac extension.</li>
		</ul>
		Other front-ends may be wedged in the same way; if you have one in mind, post it to the <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/flac-dev">flac-dev</a> mailing list.
