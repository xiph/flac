.TH "METAFLAC" "1" "02 January 2003" "" ""
.SH NAME
metaflac \- program to list, add, remove, or edit metadata in one or more FLAC files.
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBmetaflac\fR [ \fB\fIoptions\fB\fR ] [ \fB\fIoperations\fB\fR ] \fB\fIFLACfile\fB\fR\fI ...\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Use \fBmetaflac\fR to list, add, remove, or edit
metadata in one or more FLAC files.  You may perform one major operation,
or many shorthand operations at a time.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB--preserve-modtime\fR
Preserve the original modification time in spite of edits.
.TP
\fB--with-filename\fR
Prefix each output line with the FLAC file name (the default if
more than one FLAC file is specified).
.TP
\fB--no-filename\fR
Do not prefix each output line with the FLAC file name (the default
if only one FLAC file is specified).
.TP
\fB--dont-use-padding\fR
By default metaflac tries to use padding where possible to avoid
rewriting the entire file if the metadata size changes.  Use this
option to tell metaflac to not take advantage of padding this way.
.SH "SHORTHAND OPERATIONS"
.TP
\fB--show-md5sum\fR
Show the MD5 signature from the STREAMINFO block.
.TP
\fB--show-min-blocksize\fR
Show the minimum block size from the STREAMINFO block.
.TP
\fB--show-max-blocksize\fR
Show the maximum block size from the STREAMINFO block.
.TP
\fB--show-min-framesize\fR
Show the minimum frame size from the STREAMINFO block.
.TP
\fB--show-max-framesize\fR
Show the maximum frame size from the STREAMINFO block.
.TP
\fB--show-sample-rate\fR
Show the sample rate from the STREAMINFO block.
.TP
\fB--show-channels\fR
Show the number of channels from the STREAMINFO block.
.TP
\fB--show-bps\fR
Show the # of bits per sample from the STREAMINFO block.
.TP
\fB--show-total-samples\fR
Show the total # of samples from the STREAMINFO block.
.TP
\fB--show-vc-vendor\fR
Show the vendor string from the VORBIS_COMMENT block.
.TP
\fB--show-vc-field=name\fR
Show all Vorbis comment fields where the the field name matches
\&'name'.
.TP
\fB--remove-vc-field=name\fR
Remove all Vorbis comment fields whose field name is 'name'.
.TP
\fB--remove-vc-firstfield=name\fR
Remove first Vorbis comment field whose field name is 'name'.
.TP
\fB--remove-vc-all\fR
Remove all Vorbis comment fields, leaving only the vendor string
in the VORBIS_COMMENT block.
.TP
\fB--set-vc-field=field\fR
Add a Vorbis comment field.  The field must comply with the
Vorbis comment spec, of the form "NAME=VALUE".  If there is
currently no VORBIS_COMMENT block, one will be created.
.TP
\fB--import-vc-from=file\fR
Import Vorbis comments from a file.  Use '-' for stdin.  Each
line should be of the form NAME=VALUE.  Multi-line comments
are currently not supported.  Specify --remove-vc-all and/or
--no-utf8-convert before --import-vc-from if necessary.
.TP
\fB--export-vc-to=file\fR
Export Vorbis comments to a file.  Use '-' for stdin.  Each
line will be of the form NAME=VALUE.  Specify
--no-utf8-convert if necessary.
.TP
\fB--import-cuesheet-from=file\fR
Import a cuesheet from a file.  Only one FLAC file may be
specified.  A seekpoint will be added for each index point in
the cuesheet to the SEEKTABLE unless --no-cued-seekpoints is
specified.
.TP
\fB--export-cuesheet-to=file\fR
Export CUESHEET block to a cuesheet file, suitable for use by
CD authoring software.  Use '-' for stdin.  Only one FLAC file
may be specified on the command line.
.TP
\fB--add-replay-gain\fR
Calculates the title and album gains/peaks of the given FLAC
files as if all the files were part of one album, then stores
them in the VORBIS_COMMENT block.  The tags are the same as
those used by vorbisgain.  Existing ReplayGain tags will be
replaced.  If only one FLAC file is given, the album and title
gains will be the same.  Since this operation requires two
passes, it is always executed last, after all other operations
have been completed and written to disk.  All FLAC files
specified must have the same resolution, sample rate, and
number of channels.  The sample rate must be one of 8, 11.025,
12, 16, 22.05, 24, 32, 44.1, or 48 kHz.
.TP
\fB--add-seekpoint={\fI#\fB|\fIX\fB|\fI#x\fB|\fI#s\fB}\fR
Add seek points to a SEEKTABLE block.  Using #, a seek point at
that sample number is added.  Using X, a placeholder point is
added at the end of a the table.  Using #x, # evenly spaced seek
points will be added, the first being at sample 0.  Using #s, a
seekpoint will be added every # seconds (# does not have to be a
whole number; it can be, for example, 9.5, meaning a seekpoint
every 9.5 seconds).  If no SEEKTABLE block exists, one will be
created.  If one already exists, points will be added to the
existing table, and any duplicates will be turned into placeholder
points.  You may use many --add-seekpoint options; the resulting
SEEKTABLE will be the unique-ified union of all such values.
Example: --add-seekpoint=100x --add-seekpoint=3.5s will add 100
evenly spaced seekpoints and a seekpoint every 3.5 seconds.
.TP
\fB--add-padding=length\fR
Add a padding block of the given length (in bytes).  The overall
length of the new block will be 4 + length; the extra 4 bytes is
for the metadata block header.
.SH "MAJOR OPERATIONS"
.TP
\fB--list\fR
List the contents of one or more metadata blocks to stdout.  By
default, all metadata blocks are listed in text format.  Use the
following options to change this behavior:
.RS
.TP
\fB--block-number=#[,#[...]]\fR
An optional comma-separated list of block numbers to display.
The first block, the STREAMINFO block, is block 0.
.TP
\fB--block-type=type[,type[...]]\fR
.TP
\fB--except-block-type=type[,type[...]]\fR
An optional comma-separated list of block types to included
or ignored with this option.  Use only one of --block-type or
--except-block-type.  The valid block types are: STREAMINFO,
PADDING, APPLICATION, SEEKTABLE, VORBIS_COMMENT.  You may
narrow down the types of APPLICATION blocks displayed as
follows:

APPLICATION:abcd        The APPLICATION block(s) whose textual repre-
sentation of the 4-byte ID is "abcd"
APPLICATION:0xXXXXXXXX  The APPLICATION block(s) whose hexadecimal big-
endian representation of the 4-byte ID is
"0xXXXXXXXX".  For the example "abcd" above the
hexadecimal equivalalent is 0x61626364
.sp
.RS
.B "Note:"
if both --block-number and --[except-]block-type are
specified, the result is the logical AND of both
arguments.
.RE
.TP
\fB--application-data-format=hexdump|text\fR
If the application block you are displaying contains binary
data but your --data-format=text, you can display a hex dump
of the application data contents instead using
--application-data-format=hexdump.
.RE
.TP
\fB--remove\fR
Remove one or more metadata blocks from the metadata.  Unless
--dont-use-padding is specified, the blocks will be replaced with
padding.  You may not remove the STREAMINFO block.
.RS
.TP
\fB--block-number=#[,#[...]]\fR
.TP
\fB--block-type=type[,type[...]]\fR
.TP
\fB--except-block-type=type[,type[...]]\fR
See --list above for usage.
.sp
.RS
.B "Note:"
if both --block-number and --[except-]block-type are
specified, the result is the logical AND of both arguments.
.RE
.RE
.TP
\fB--remove-all\fR
Remove all metadata blocks (except the STREAMINFO block) from the
metadata.  Unless --dont-use-padding is specified, the blocks will
be replaced with padding.
.TP
\fB--merge-padding\fR
Merge adjacent PADDING blocks into single blocks.
.TP
\fB--sort-padding\fR
Move all PADDING blocks to the end of the metadata and merge them
into a single block.
